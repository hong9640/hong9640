### ðŸŒ± Interests & Background

I majored in **Mechanical Engineering** and have hands-on experience assisting in **gas turbine maintenance**.  
This gave me a **strong understanding of mechanical systems** and **real-world industrial operations**.  

While my academic background is rooted in machinery, my recent interests have expanded into **AIoT**, **AI**, and **drones**â€”fields where **software and hardware deeply interact**.  

Although my current project (a **book recommendation website**) is not directly aligned with these interests,  
it allowed me to gain valuable experience in:  
- **Data handling**  
- **Backend architecture**  
- **User-facing design**

I believe these skills are **transferable** and form a strong base for future work in **intelligent systems** and **industry-specific platforms**, including **finance** or **smart manufacturing**.
